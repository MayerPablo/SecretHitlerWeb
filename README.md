# Further Information:
- Goal is to create a Open-Source easy to use web application for playing the Boardgame Secret Hitler
- Inspired by socializing with friends and the corona crisis 
- It would be best if the user wouldn't have to do port forwarding, for that I would have to get a VPS as a reverse proxy
