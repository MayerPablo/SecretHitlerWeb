# SecretHitlerWeb
Webbrowser Version of SecretHitler

# How to Use:
- Open Start.bat 
- Check wheter your server is online by typing 127.0.0.1:2000 or alternatively localhost:2000 in your URL Tab

# Further Information:
- Goal is to create a Open-Source easy to use web application for playing the Boardgame Secret Hitler
- Inspired by socializing with friends and the corona crisis 
- It would be best if the user wouldn't have to do port forwarding, for that I would have to get a VPS as a reverse proxy

# HAVE FUN!
